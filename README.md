Scraper for an unnamed retail website. The site holds spontaneous auctions without listings or records, so I made this scraper to record them. The actual url and strings have been removed from the code to prevent legal trouble. I also wrote a scraper for the product listings on the website (prodscrape.py) which records the product name, wholesale price and MSRP.

stogscrape.py scrapes the auctions, while prodscrape.py scrapes the product listings, of which there are over 6000.
